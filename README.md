This program will show the user the current weather from anywhere in the world.
The user can see the weather in a specific location by typing it in or selecting a city from a list of popular cities.
The program also has a built in joke generator. The user can choose to view a weather, programming, or video game joke and view it with a delayed punchline.
To access all the jokes the attached csv files must be downloaded.
There is also an option for the user to change the background color of the GUI.
The tkinter module is used throughout the program in order to create an easy to use GUI.
It uses the tkinter, pandas, time, requests, and random modules.
